      <h2 class="vertically-centered">What is CBT</h2>
      <p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or CBT is a short term, goal focused therapy that has been proven to help treat a
        range of psychological conditions.</p>
      <p>CBT directly addresses the thoughts and actions that lead to distressing emotions. 

      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><em>Tom is sitting in his office working on a project. He starts to think: “I'm never going to complete this,
          my boss is going to kill me!” Consequently, Tom starts to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work, he then
          starts procrastinating by checking his emails and making multiple cups of coffee. This behaviour reinforces
          Tom's thoughts “I'm never going to complete this!” making him feel even more stressed.</em></p>
      <p>This is a very common anxiety cycle found in CBT. In therapy, we would work to break it by helping Tom to pay
        attention to the thoughts he has in the office. We would then work to develop more helpful responses by
        challenging the thoughts and testing out alternative behaviours.</p>

        <h3>How I work</h3>
        <p>I use cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, to help people identify the unhelpful behaviours and thoughts
          that
          maintain the problem and prevent them from moving forward. My therapy is a collaborative and transparent
          process
          in which I work with the client to help them find the answers to their problem. I believe that by the end of
          treatment a person should be equipped with the skills to act as their own therapist and manage whatever
          setbacks
          they may encounter.</p>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>I begin therapy with an assessment session to discuss the problem in detail and explore ways in which CBT may
          be helpful. Following the assessment, I start by offering six sessions of CBT and then review.</p>
        <p>Each session will last 50 minutes.</p>
        <p>The average number of sessions people require is usually between eight and fifteen sessions depending on the
          presenting problem.</p>
